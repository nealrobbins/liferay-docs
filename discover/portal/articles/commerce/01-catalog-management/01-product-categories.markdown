# Product Categories

Products can be organized into *Categories*. These groupings allow products to be 
handled as a single unit. For example, a product category could be used to 
apply discounts or other offers to a set of products, to assist buyers in 
finding products, or to promote certain products to a specified user segment.

To organize products into categories, you must create the categories first and
then assign products to them.

## Creating Categories

To create vocabularies, categories and subcategories, go to *Site Menu* &rarr;
*Content* &rarr; *Categories*. To learn more about the process, go to the
[Defining Categories for
Content](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/organizing-content-with-tags-and-categories#defining-categories-for-content)
section.

Note: Categories are designed to be nested into a hierarchy. While this allows
multiple categories to be grouped together and handled as a single unit, it
also makes it difficult for administrators to see the entire vocabulary. To
view all categories at once, go to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration*
&rarr; *System Settings* &rarr; *Assets* and select *Flattened Tree* from the
drop-down menu in *Asset Categories Web*. Then return to *Site Menu* &rarr;
*Content* &rarr; *Categories*.

## Adding and Removing Products From Categories

To add a product to one or more categories:

1.  Go to the catalog, select a product, and open its *Categorization* tab.

2.  Click on the *Select* button under the label for the appropriate
    vocabulary, and the check the box next to each category that applies.

3.  Click Save.

A product can be removed from a category the same way by unchecking the boxes in
step 2. Alternatively, several products can be removed at once using the
category application:

1.  Find the category you want at *Site Menu* &rarr; *Content* &rarr;
    *Categories*. Then click ![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)
    &rarr; *Edit*, and select the *Products* tab.

2.  Check the box next to each product you want to remove from the category.

NOTE: Currently I don't see a checkbox next to products.

3.  Click *Remove*.

## Other Category Associations 

You may want to associate more than just products with your categories. Creating
relationships with pages and images can give you greater capabilities to
display category content dynamically. NOTE: Last sentence is very unclear.

### Category Display Page

The category display page is a feature that creates a relationship between
a category and a specified page. This relationship makes it easy to display and
organize content or applications related to to that category, as changes made
to the category will be automatically reflected on the page. A typical use case
might involve using the page to display category content for customers, but the
feature could just as easily create a page for internal use. NOTE: Revise. The
use case is not helpful in understanding why category display pages exist.

To create a category display page:

1.  Create a page. At any point, populate the page with whatever content or
    applications suit your purposes. NOTE: Second sentence is ot helpful for 
    these instructions. Consider adding this as  a note after the instructions
    are completed.

2.  Find the category you want to associate with the page in *Site Menu* &rarr;
    *Content* &rarr; *Categories*. Then click
    ![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png) &rarr; *Edit*, and select the
    Category Display Page tab. 

3.  Click *Choose* and select the page you just created.

4.  Click *Done* to close the pop-up and then click *Save*.

### Images

You may want to upload images and associate them with a product category. These
images can be displayed on a category display page, on the display pages for
products that are assigned to the category, or anywhere else you want to display
category content. NOTE: use cases are unclear.

To assign images to a category:

1.  Find the category you want at *Site Menu* &rarr; *Content* &rarr;
    *Categories*. Then click ![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)
    &rarr; *Edit*, and select the *images* tab.

2.  Click on the [Add](../../../images/icon-add.png) button. You can either 
    upload an image or choose one from the Documents and Media Repository. 

3.  Click *Save*.
