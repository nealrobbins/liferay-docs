# Customer Portal

The Beryl Customer Portal is a sample store that models a B2B scenario in which
each buyer is provided with an account through which to conduct transactions.
Beryl can be used simply as a sandbox to gain familiarity with @commerce@, but
it can also give you a head start on setting up a fully functional store.

Beryl gives you a working portal with an account management system, a sample
catalog, and working pages for checkout, order processing and managing
shipments. Other features, such as payment methods, shipping methods, and taxes,
still need to be set up manually.

## Setting up Beryl

To use Beryl, you must create your store site via a [site
initializer](dead-link). Follow these steps: 

1.  Go to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Sites* &rarr; *Sites*.

2.  Click on the [Add](../../images/icon-add.png) button and select *Beryl*.

3.  Enter a name for your store and click *Submit*.
