# Pricing [](id=pricing)

On its most basic level, pricing is handled in the catalog (see
[SKUs](web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/7-1/adding-options-to-products#pricing)).
When all you want to do is assign one price to one SKU, that's all you need. But
if you want to do something a little more sophisticated, *discounts* and *price
lists* are useful.

A **Price List** allows you to change a product's base price exclusively for
members of a specified user segment.

A **Discount** does not change a product's base price but instead applies
a modifier to it.

Should you use a price list or a discount to adjust your products' prices?

It depends. If you want to offer a special price exclusively to a particular
group of customers, and you want to be able to manually set the adjusted price
for each product individually, then you should use a price list.

If you want to set prices using a currency other than your store's default, or
if you want to increase prices rather than lower them, then you should use
a price list.

If you want to apply a blanket modifier to a group of products, however---for
instance, 10% off everything in the catalog, or $10 off everything in
a particular category---then you should use a discount. A discount can be
applied to a specific user segment or made available to all customers.

If you want limit the number of products that can be bought for the adjusted
price, or if you only want the special pricing to be available to customers who
enter a coupon code, or only to customers who spend or have spent a specified
amount, then you should use a discount.
