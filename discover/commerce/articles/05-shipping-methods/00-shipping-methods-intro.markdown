# Shipping Methods [](id=shipping-methods)

When a buyer places an order, she should be prompted to choose among a variety
of shipping options. You can create as many shipping options as you like, but
they all calculate shipping costs using one of three methods:

**Flat Rate** shipping applies the same price to every product in the catalog.

**Variable Rate** shipping allows you to set up a formula to calculate a unique
rate for each order, on the basis of weight, product price, or other factors.

**Carrier** shipping allows you align your shipping processes closely with
those of a particular shipping company. This can help ensure that the prices you
charge your customers closely match your actual shipping costs.

You can create any number of options for each method, but remember that every
shipping option you create will be available to ship every product in the
catalog.
