# Restrictions [](id=restrictions)

No matter what shipping methods you use, you have the option to apply
restrictions. A restriction will make a shipping method unavailable for
shipments to selected countries or regions. To apply a restriction, go to
a shipping method and click on the *Restrictions* tab. Then click the
![Add](../../images/icon-add.png) button and select whatever countries or regions
you want to restrict.

You may not want a shipping method to be available to customers all over the
world. Follow these steps to limit a shipping method to specified countries:

1.  From the *Shipping Methods* tab (*Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr;
    *Settings* &rarr; *Shipping Methods*), click on a shipping method and
    then on the *Restrictions* tab.

2.  Click on the ![Add](../../images/icon-add.png) button and check the box next
    to each country for which you want to permit shipping by this method. Click
    *Add*.

These restrictions apply to all shipping options that method, but not to options
of any other method.

To permit shipping to all countries, it is not necessary to list each one
separately. Simply leave the restriction list empty.
