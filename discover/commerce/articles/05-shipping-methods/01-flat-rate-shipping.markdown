# Flat Rate Shipping [](id=fixed-shipping-method)

When you create a flat rate shipping option, you create an option that any buyer
can choose to use to ship any product. By creating multiple flat rate options,
you can give customers various choices in terms of cost, speed, and security.

Flat rate shipping imposes the same cost on every product in the catalog.
However, you can create exceptions for individual products from the *Shipping
Extra Price* field in the product's
[Configuration](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowlede_base/7-1/configuration#shipping)
tab.

## Creating a Flat Rate Shipping Option 

Follow these steps:

1.  Go to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Settings* and click on the
    *Shipping Method* tab. Click on the *Flat Rate* method and then on the
    *Shipping Options* tab.

2.  Click on the ![Add](../../images/icon-add.png) button and fill in the
    following fields:

    **Name:** this is the name that buyers will see when they are prompted to
    select a shipping option.

    **Description:** Information about the option---delivery time, guarantees,
    insurance and the like---should go in this field.

    **Amount:** Set the method's cost.

    **Priority:** Sets the order in which options will be displayed. Lower
    numbers come first.

3.  Click *Save*. To create more than one option, repeat steps 2 and 3 as
    needed.

4.  Click on the *Details* tab and check the *Active* box. Click *Save*.

The *Details* tab also contains fields for changing the name and description of
the flat rate shipping method, which may be useful for reference, but the
text is not automatically displayed to customers. You can also set a priority,
which orders flat rate shipping options relative to options of other methods..
