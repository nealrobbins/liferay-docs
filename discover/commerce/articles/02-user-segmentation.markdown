# User Segmentation [](id=user-segmentation)

User Segmentation allows you to organize users, primarily customers, into
groups. This allows price lists, discounts, and other features to be precisely
targeted to appropriate segments.

Segments can be defined in a variety of ways. You can select users individually,
by role, or select whole organizations or user groups to include. You are not
limited to one type; for example you could create a segment that consists of the
members of an organization plus a number of other users that you designate by
role.

User segments are not static. At any point, you can return to a segment and make
changes to its membership. Any changes you make will be applied to any price
lists or other features associated with the segment.

## Creating a User Segment [](id=creating-a-user-segment)

Follow these steps:

1.  Go to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *User Segments*.

2.  Click on the ![Add](../images/icon-add.png) button at the top right and
    enter a name for the segment when prompted. Click *Submit*.

3.  Click on the user group to edit it. Fill in the following fields:

    **Key:** A unique identifier for referring to this segment programmatically.
    This field is filled automatically, so most users can safely leave it alone.

    **Priority:** If a user is in more than one segment and a conflict occurs,
    the segment with the higher priority is used. Segments are prioritized in
    numerical order.

    **Active:** Uncheck this box to disable the segment and treat its users as
    if they were not members.

4.  Click *Save*.

Now you've created a user segment, but it has no members. Follow these steps to
add users:

1.  After creating a segment, click on the *Criteria* tab. Then click on the
    ![Add](../images/icon-add.png) button to open the *Add Criterion* form.

2.  Select a *Type* from the drop-down menu and choose whether to add *Users*,
    *Organizations*, *User Groups*, or *Roles* to the segment.

3.  When you make your choice, a *Select* button appears beneath the drop-down.
    Click on it and then check the box next to each user (or organization, user
    group, or role) you want to include in the segment. Click *Add*.

4.  Set a priority for the criterion and hit *Save*.

5.  To add additional criteria, repeat steps 1 through 4, selecting a different
    type in step 2.

Note: When you create a user segment with more than one criteria, the criteria
are combined inclusively. For example, if you make a user segment including
members of the organization "Procurement" in addition to the user group
"Purchasing Managers", the resulting segment would every user who is a member of
*either* group. It would not be limited to users who are members of *both*.
