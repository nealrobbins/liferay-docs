# Catalog Rules

Catalog Rules work with 
[user segments](web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/7-1/user-segmentation)
to restrict specified buyers so that they can only see a limited portion of the
catalog. This can help focus the attention of a customer who---for instance---is
only authorized to purchase products associated with a particular support plan,
or who wants the convenience of only seeing parts and accessories for equipment
that he already owns.

Follow these steps:

1.  Go to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Catalog Rules* and click on the
    ![Add](../../images/icon-add.png) button.

2.  Give the rule a *Name*, check the box next to *Active*, and select
    *Categories* from the drop-down box.

3.  Click on the *Select* button that appears and click on as many categories as
    you want specified users to be able to see. Click *Done*.

4.  Click *Save*. A new tab, *User Segments*, appears at the top of the page.

5.  Click on *User Segments* and then click the
    ![Add](../../images/icon-add.png) button, and select whichever segment or
    segments you want to be limited to the selected categories. Click *Add*.
