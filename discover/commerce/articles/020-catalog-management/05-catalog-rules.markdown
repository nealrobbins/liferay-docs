# Catalog Rules [](id=catalog-rules)

Catalog Rules manage the catalog's visibility. They work with [user
segments](/web/commerce/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/user-segmentation) to
control what portions of the catalog a buyer can see. This can help focus the
attention of customers only authorized to purchase products associated with
a particular support plan, or who want the convenience of only seeing parts and
accessories for equipment they already own.

By default, all users are blacklisted: if no catalog rules are in place, then no
users (except Site administrators) will be able to see the catalog at all.

**Note:** If more than one catalog rule is applied to a single user, the rules
will combine exclusively. Only products that are permitted by all the applicable
rules will be visible.

Follow these steps:

1.  Go to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Catalog Rules* and click on the
    ![Add](../../images/icon-add.png) button.

2.  Give the rule a *Name* and enable the *Active* toggle. To make the entire
    catalog visible, select *All products* from the *Type* drop-down box. To
    limit the catalog's visibility, select *Categories*.

3.  If you selected *Categories*, Click the *Select* button that appears and
    select the categories you want specified users to be able to see. Click
    *Done*.

4.  Click *Save*. A new tab, *User Segments*, appears at the top of the page.

5.  Click on *User Segments* and then click the
    ![Add](../../images/icon-add.png) button. Select the segment or segments to
    which this rule should apply. Click *Add*.

    If you specify more than one segment, the rule applies exclusively. Only
    users who belong to all the specified segments will be included.

**Note:** In step 2 above, the *Catalog* selection is the only type that
actually restricts the catalog's visibility. With the development of additional
code, you can add other custom types, allowing sections of the catalog to be
selected by individual product, by specification, or by other criteria.
